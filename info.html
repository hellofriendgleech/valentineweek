    <h1>Why I Made This Website</h1>
    <p>
        With the way things were going and now that the time table is here it is pretty obvious that we won’t be able to meet every day for this year’s Valentine’s week and as such I knew I could not deliver you letters for each day or hug you on hug day or kiss you on kiss day and so on. It wasn’t even confirmed if you would be here in Bhopal and as such I needed a solution that could help me to deliver my feelings to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the idea of creating a website for this Valentine’s week was planted in my mind. I thought about it a lotttt, like seriously a lotttt, for weeks I came up with different ideas and then I tried multiple ideas, some were scrapped, most you would see here as the days come by. I am not good at web development by any account but I tried my best. This is MY website that I made for YOU. Every single line of code, every animation I added, even every single prompt I gave to ChatGPT (lol) all of it is filled with my love for you. And as such, I hope you really love and cherish it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also remember how you once told me that someone made a website for you and you really admired that... I wanted to be admited by you  Well I don't wish to live in anyone's shadows or copy anyone but I hope that this website comes out to be your favourite website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well in the end I love you most and I am excited to see your reaction for each day as the other pages unlock. I love you forever Shubhanshi. Be Mine. Stay Mine. Forever Mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yours forever,<br>
